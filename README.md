## Awaken Your AI

The prompt consists of series of gameplay instruction to the language model and a list of scenarios and roles that the model will use for the game. Once you have entered the prompt into a chatbot you will be presented with the scenario and your role, which includes your position to debate from, either for or against. You can also make the model debate itself by using the HINT feature repeatedly. When you type STOP, the round will end, and the model will offer to optionally help refine and improve your position. Read the prompt for more details. Adapt the prompt for your own scenarios and roles.
